[Full Changelog](https://github.com/markoleptic/EncounterPlanner/compare/v1.2.2...1.2.3)

-   Added a "Favorite" submenu to the assignment editor spell dropdown. Click the star icon beside a spell to add it to the submenu. Click the star icon again or click the X beside the spell in the "Favorite" submenu to remove it.
-   Fixed an issue where dropdown items were sometimes wider than intended.
