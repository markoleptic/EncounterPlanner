[Full Changelog](https://github.com/markoleptic/EncounterPlanner/compare/2.1.0...2.1.1)

-   Edit boxes are now easier to deal with (Import from Text dialog).
-   Added the ability import assignments from text directly into the current plan (previously required overwriting or creating a new plan).
    -   Non-assignment lines are appended to the current plan's External Text.
-   The text of a radio button can now be clicked (previously had to click actual button).
-   Translations updates (ZamestoTV).
-   Fixed "Import" text using a raw string instead of a localized string.
