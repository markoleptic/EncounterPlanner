# [2.0.6](https://github.com/markoleptic/EncounterPlanner/tree/2.0.6) (2025-08-13)

[Full Changelog](https://github.com/markoleptic/EncounterPlanner/compare/2.0.5...2.0.6)

-   Empty plans are now created for any bossâ€“difficulty combination that does not already have one. These can be deleted if unwanted and will not be recreated.
-   Plans without any assignments involving the player no longer incur any overhead (i.e. no combat log event unfiltered monitoring) past the initial check.
