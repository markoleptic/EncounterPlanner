### New Reminder Widget: Cooldown Icons

-   Cooldown Icons are similar to WeakAuras that show cooldown durations.
    They show an icon with a duration and radial swipe animation.
-   Cooldown Icons only appear for spell assignments (do not appear for text-only assignments).
-   This feature is disabled by default but can be enabled in **Preferences -> Reminder**.

### Preferences Menu

-   Changed the ordering of preferences found in the Reminder tab.
-   Added the option to shrink reminder text to fit for Progress Bars.
    This is enabled by default.
