[Full Changelog](https://github.com/markoleptic/EncounterPlanner/compare/2.1.1...2.1.2)

-   Re-categorized and updated the spell dropdown menu.
    -   Each class is now split into five categories: Core, Group Utility, External Defensive, Personal Defensive, and Other.
    -   Core contains major individual cooldowns.
    -   Group Utility includes spells which affect others that are typically assigned.
    -   Not all classes will have all five categories.
    -   The spell dropdown in the Assignment Editor is now filtered based on the class and role of an individual. It is also filtered when the assignee is a class or spec.
    -   Removed spells that have been removed from the game, PVP spells, and all equipment trinkets.
    -   Replaced the "Trinkets" item with "Consumables" and added commonly used potions.
    -   Added some missing spells.
-   The version number in the title of the main window can now be clicked to display patch notes.
